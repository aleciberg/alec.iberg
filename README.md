# My Current Personal Website Build

## WEBSITE IS IN PROGRESS

## TODO

- Mobile Friendly (Top Priority)
- Enable Resume to be downloaded
- Changelog Tab
- Footer
- LOGO

## TO PUBLISH

In Terminal: <br>
`npm run predeploy` <br>
`npm run deploy`

GH Pages Settings need to be `master` and have the correct custom domain.

Seems to take a bit- just be patient.
Do I have to cycle between the gh-pages and master branch or am I just impatient?
Will try again when I publish new paragraph.

npm run deploy changes my custom domain
