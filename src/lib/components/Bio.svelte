  Hello, my name is <span class={"attention"}>Alec Iberg</span> and I am a Full
  Stack Developer.
  <br />
  <br />
  I currently work at
  <a class={"link"} target={"_blank"} href={"https://array.com"}>Array</a>, as a
  Software Engineer II, building Digital Financial Management tools. I currently
  work with{" "}
  <span class="target">
    JavaScript, TypeScript, Svelte, NodeJS, and GoLang{" "}
  </span>
  and very much enjoy this stack. I always find great satisfaction in seeing my work
  produce
  <span class="target">meaningful </span>
  and
  <span class="target"> measurable</span> results and I love being able to
  provide value to the Financial Wellness space and improve access to credit for
  <span class="target">everyone.</span>
  <br />
  <br />
  {" "}
  As for my personal life, I really enjoy the{" "}
  <span class="attention">outdoors</span>- you can usually find me camping,
  hiking, or backpacking on a weekend. I am fortunate enough to
  <span class="target"> live in Portland</span> and be surrounded by some of our
  nation's best outdoor beauty.{" "}
  <span class={"attention"}>Mount Hood</span> is probably my favorite.
  Additionally, I am a huge College Football fan (GO BUCKEYES!), a big hockey
  fan, and I very much enjoy spending time with my dog,

  with unlimited energy.
